* about alien *

{{{
alien is a program that converts between Red Hat rpm, Debian deb, Stampede slp, Slackware tgz, and Solaris pkg file formats. If you want to use a
       package from another linux distribution than the one you have installed on your system, you can use alien to convert it to your preferred package
       format and install it. It also supports LSB packages.
